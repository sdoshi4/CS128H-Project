# CS128H-Project
This is Shaan Doshi and Kevin Huang's CS128H Final Project

The project will involve building a neural network.
We are coding a neural network from scratch using no libraries. We are using a tree based structure to implement forward propogation. We are using a genetic algorithm to train our neural network to find racial disparities in housing in certain areas. 

One challenge is that the genetic algorithm isn't accurate enough to classify the data. We can also find challenges in training the data in parallel on different epochs.

# CS128H-Project
This is Shaan Doshi and Kevin Huang's CS128H Final Project

The project will involve building a neural network.
We are coding a neural network from scratch using no libraries. We are using a tree based structure to implement forward propogation. We are then using a genetic algorithm to train our neural network on a dataset to find racial disparities in housing in certain areas. With this genetic algorithm, we can implement parallelism to speed up our processing of different generations.

One challenge is that the genetic algorithm isn't accurate enough to classify the data, since we are not implementing convolutions or backpropogation.
